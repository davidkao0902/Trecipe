### k7y0b

1. What you’ve worked on in the previous two weeks
2. What you’ll be working on in the next two weeks
3. Where you might have gotten stuck during the last two weeks

### c8y0b

1. What you’ve worked on in the previous two weeks
    - Implement and Create React Component for Trecipe Card, Popup after `Add`
2. What you’ll be working on in the next two weeks
    - Implement Map display in the Trecipe Page and add button to bring up popup with search bar 
3. Where you might have gotten stuck during the last two weeks.
    - There was a little bit of learning curve after switching to Typescript from Javascript and since we did not use an external library for styling, some of the tweaks took more time than I expected.


### o1u1b

1. What you’ve worked on in the previous two weeks
    - Started out by setting up the project with Create-React-app + typescript. I then implemented a menu component and a card menu component for the Trecipe card.
2. What you’ll be working on in the next two weeks
    - Implement the add and edit button on Trecipe page, clicking the edit button should bring up three additional buttons (check, delete, reorder)
3. Where you might have gotten stuck during the last two weeks
    - Ensuring the menu component is always within the viewport was a challenge. The calculation was a bit more complicated than I anticipated as it involves two coordinate systems.

### z8c1b

1. What you’ve worked on in the previous two weeks
   - The beginning of the sprint was getting the UX mocks for My Trecipes page and all the required components up, then I implemented the navigation bars and the search bar component, and finally integrating the different components into one My Trecipes page.
2. What you’ll be working on in the next two weeks
   - Same as this sprint, first part is preparing the mocks for the Trecipe's detail page, and also setting up for redux. Then, I will implement a component for displaying a destination in a Trecipe, and finally integrating components to form the Trecipe detail page.
3. Where you might have gotten stuck during the last two weeks
   - Because we chose to implement all our components on our own, styling them the way we want took me more time than I expected. Making sure our components can handle different screen sizes is also an ongoing challenge I need to look into.
