1. What you’ve worked on in the previous two weeks
The beginning of the sprint was getting the UX mocks for My Trecipes page and all the required components up, then I implemented the navigation bars and the search bar component, and finally integrating the different components into one My Trecipes page.
2. What you’ll be working on in the next two weeks
Same as this sprint, first part is preparing the mocks for the Trecipe's detail page, and also setting up for redux. Then, I will implement a component for displaying a destination in a Trecipe, and finally integrating components to form the Trecipe detail page.
3. Where you might have gotten stuck during the last two weeks
Because we chose to implement all our components on our own, styling them the way we want took me more time than I expected. Making sure our components can handle different screen sizes is also an ongoing challenge I need to look into.
