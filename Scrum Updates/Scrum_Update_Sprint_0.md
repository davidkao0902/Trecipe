1. What you’ve worked on in the previous two weeks
    - We spent most of the time on project planning, which includes defining the scope of our project and dicsussing the requirements.
2. What you’ll be working on in the next two weeks
    - I will be working on setting up the logic for uploading photo locally, and the frontend for context filter
3. Where you might have gotten stuck during the last two weeks.
    - Maybe in deciding which functionalities should be minimal and which ones are not. It was slightly harder to decide but eventually we agreed on focusing on frontend with single user first.

1. What you’ve worked on in the previous two weeks
    - Brainstorming project ideas, planning project feature , deciding project's potential user, general UI design, breaking down tasks into issues.
2. What you’ll be working on in the next two weeks
    - Implement and Create React Component for Trecipe Card, Popup after `Add`, and assist Yun for Photo Logic.
3. Where you might have gotten stuck during the last two weeks.
    - Deciding the name and key features for our website were some hard decisions for us. It was difficult to think outside of the box when there are many well-developed travel sites in the market and to find gaps in user demand.

1. What you’ve worked on in the previous two weeks
    - We had a few meetings and discussed the project requirements, name, features, and page design of the website. 
2. What you’ll be working on in the next two weeks
    - For the next two weeks, I will setup the project, implement the front end for right click menu, and integrate Trecipe card component into a page.
3. Where you might have gotten stuck during the last two weeks
    - We had a bit of difficulty coming up with a name for the website. In the end, the idea of adding ingredients to a trip sounds awesome, so we chose Trecipe which is a combination of trip and recipe.
