3. Where you might have gotten stuck during the last two weeks
    - The merge conflicts I had while I was reorganizing the project was interesting. Some files are modified on both branches, some files no longer exists, and some files have been renamed and moved. :scream: Git was able to identify some of these changes, but I had to manually resolve the remaining conflicts.
