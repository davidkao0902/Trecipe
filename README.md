# Trecipe

CPSC 436I Project: Team2 

## Project description

Trecipe helps travellers to discover wonderful destinations and put together their dream bucket list trip. Users will be able to create and store their travel bucket list on Trecipe. A destination can be searched based on the categories, country, and even review. Once a destination is added to a bucket list, users can track their progress and view all the destination on a map. A bucket list can also be made public for other users to discover it. To enable these activies, we will make use of data such as a bucket list (name, timestamp of creation, last modified timestamp, owner's id, privacy setting, destination ids, collaborator ids, and which destinations are checked off), destination info (destination id to retreive info from external API), and user information (name, password, id, email).

Our stretch goals include adding collaborators to any bucket list, viewing popular bucket list, and allowing users to write a full review of a destination.

## Unit 1-5 Learning Goals:
### Unit 1: HTML, CSS, JS
By setting up global variables with Mixins, a SCSS functionality for theme colors and font sizes, better codability was made possible. Since we had customised css designs for the entire project, this tool was important for us to maintain consistency in the look of our website.
We also decided to use TypeScript over JavaScript when developing our project to ensure type safety.

### Unit 2: React & Redux
Created more than 30 reusable react components with TypeScript such as the TrecipeCards, DestinationCards, and Buttons. Restricting types on the component props with the help ot TS also increased robustness in our webapp. We also used redux to allow data change without reloading the entire page every time.

### Unit 3: Mongo DB
We set up MongoDB for a NoSQL Database to host all data related to Trecipe, destination, user information, and ratings etc. Mongoose provides a `virtual` attribute to give developers flexibilities, so that a given modelâ€™s values can be set either manually or automatically with defined functionality. <Example> When implementing destinations in Trecipes, many-to-many relationship is easily achieved by use of Mongoose Virtual.

### Unit 4: Node & Express
Used Express with TypeScript to implement endpoints queried by our react frontend. We also attached OpenAPIValidation middleware to our endpoints for validating incoming requests and outgoing responses. This extension enabled better visibility of errors that occured during querying.

### Unit 5: Release Engineering
Deployed and hosted Trecipe website on Heroku which is beginner/start-up friendly. We also used Heroku's GitHub integration to automate the deployment process, which lead to increased maintainabiliy and less build breaks.

## Above and Beyond Functionalities
### Custom CSS
We chose not to use ready made components/designs for our site, instead, most of our styles are done via custom css. This allowed us to have more flexibility in terms of styling, as well as maintaining an overall consistent theme that aligns with the setting of this project, making our site more memorable and outstanding.

### Integration with Google API
We have very good integration with Google API, we use Google to look up destinations, pull reviews as well as images for destinations. This integration enabled our users to perform powerful search, see the destinations being displayed on Google Map, and allowed us to display information-rich pages that will be useful for users.
