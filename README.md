# Trecipe

CPSC 436I Project

## Project description

Trecipe helps travellers to discover wonderful destinations and put together their dream bucket list trip. Users will be able to create and store their travel bucket list on Trecipe. A destination can be searched based on the categories, country, and even review. Once a destination is added to a bucket list, users can track their progress and view all the destination on a map. A bucket list can also be made public for other users to discover it.  

Our stretch goals include adding collaborators to any bucket list, viewing popular bucket list, and allowing users to write a full review of a destination.
